======
Is a little tool to see the Windows PE files.
Currently it shows MZ header info and PE info with pe sections and directories.
It can not traverse you in to inter section linkages. but Soon it will.
till then enjoy

WHY?
====
I wrote a similar tool during 1997-99, written using DJGPP(Thanks to DJ Dellorie) 
and it was in Yahoo briefcase and Yahoo geocities.It was never recovered from those sites. 
So i thought I should re-write it using Qt.
